# Searcher
Small fun tool for faster coding researches.

Used for open multiple different pages when I search something on internet. I mainly use it for youtube and google and search for videos and webpages at the same time in order to rapidly solve my coding issues.

To launch this program:
 go to your promt, find the folder (directory) that contains Searcher and digit: python Searcher

I used:
TKinter module for the visualInterface.py
Webbrowser, Pathlib modules for the PageManager.py 


# ATTENTION
You have to add the exact domain in order to add new pages you can't just add
https://www.google.com/
THIS DOESN'T WORK
For more details go check the domains.txt

TODO
Add the delete domain functionality
